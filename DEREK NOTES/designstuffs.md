#### ¿WHY MARKDOWN?
1. Boring old Linkeroo:

2. Here is an example of a sexy sleek subtle link: [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)


With atom open, at that cool little top tool bar ( Sign | File | Edit | View | Selection | Find | Packages | Window | Help)

From the toolbar; with that cute lil arrow you call a cursor.
 Go to Packages
Hover till that bad boy drops down all those glorious options.

The one your looking for is called "Markdown Preview"

- Hover on your soon to be discovered life changing experience until it shows you the option to 'Toggle Preview'
(You will need to do this on every markdown you want to preview in pretty form)
